# bamazon_app

This is the BAMAZON APP.  Sort of like Amazon, the online shopping platfrom.  This application first displays all of the items available for sale. It includes the product ids, names, and prices of products for sale.

Upon opening, it prompts users with two messages:
(1) It asks for the ID of the product the customer wants to buy.
(2) It also asks how many units of the product they would like.

Once the customer has placed the order, the application checks if the store has enough of the product to meet the customer's request.

If not, the app lets the customer know that there isn't sufficient quantity.

If the store does have enough of the product, it fulfills the customer's order and provides the total purchase price.

As expected, it updates the SQL database to reflect the remaining quantity.
